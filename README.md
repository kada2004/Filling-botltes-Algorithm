# Filling-botltes-Algorithm
# Overview

This Pyhton script simulates a simple bottle filling system. it calculates how many bottles can be filled in a day, 
tracks the total capacity filled in a day, and update the main tank's capacity until it reaches zero. 
the script assumes constant working hours and fixed time to fill one bottle.

# Variable
. `main_capacity_of_tank`: The initial capacity of the main tank(in liters) set to 3606 liters.
. `time_required_to_fill_one_botlle`: The time (in minutes) required to fill one bottle, set to 1 minute.
. `working_time_in_a_day` : The total working time in a day(in minutes), set to 12 hours (720 minutes).
. `day_number`: A counter to keep track of the day number

# Output
The script prints the day number and the number of bottles filled in each day and indicates when the filling process is complete.

>>> Note: This code assumes constant working conditions and may not account for real-world factors like variations in filling time or equipment maintenance
